              I began my time at UGA as a Computer Science major and found the New Media Certificate in my first semester after deciding to search for another major.  Without my knowledge, this ended up being the first step in my path toward applying to Grady and the Entertainment and Media Studies major.  The New Media Institute acted as a great bridge between my technical interests that initially led me to a computer science major and my artistic/creative interests that I would soon find and develop in my EMST major.  I took the introductory course in the Fall of 2019 and followed it up with a web design course.  This introduction to web design served as the catalyst for my wanting to continue down the path of getting the NMI certificate and working on UI/UX in a professional capacity.  I stepped a little bit out of my comfort zone in an attempt to expand my knowledge about UI/UX design on different platforms by taking Rich Media Production and working on mobile apps in the Apple ecosystem.  In my penultimate semester with the NMI, I was excited to be able to enroll in Advanced Web Development and continue the web work I had done a few semesters earlier.  I concluded the certificate by taking the Capstone along with Xpert hours, which were really great additions to my final year at UGA.
