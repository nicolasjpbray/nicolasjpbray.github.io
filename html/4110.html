              <p>This course was my introduction to web design, something that I now do professionally.  This class served as the foundation of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.  These three languages were used in consort to learn the basics of UX/UI design.  In addition to hand-coding sites with these three languages, students were introduced to Content Management Systems by using WordPress.  These skills turned out to be essential in every web project I’ve worked on since, and my familiarity with working on Content Management Systems for NMIX classes has made my job as a UX/UI designer infinitely easier.</p>
              
            

              <p>My favorite project in this course was one of the custom websites we were required to build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The objective was to create a hand-crafted website centered around any topic of interest.  I’d just bought and played a game called “DOOM Eternal,” and was able to make a website for that title.  This allowed me to design a fully cohesive experience complete with audio, video, fonts, and imagery from the franchise.  My passion for the content also drove me to attempt some fairly ambitious interactive JavaScript sections across this site.</p>
