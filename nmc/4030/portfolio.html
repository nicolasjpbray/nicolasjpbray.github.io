            <p class="text">This class was a bit of a challenge for me, which is a good thing.  If I want to work in the tech industry, I'll hvae to get used to learning new things and quickly adapting to unfamiliar platforms/environments.  I'm not an apple guy.  I've only owned Android and Windows over the past decade so working exclusively on Apple devices for Apple devices was uncomfortable.  Despite this, I found a way to enjoy the class and improve my familiarity with the Apple Ecosystem.  I'm also an EMST major and much of our video work is done on Macintosh devices so this introduction has already been helpful to me in my academic career.</p>
