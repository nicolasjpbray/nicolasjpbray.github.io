            <p class="text">This was the first coding course I took in college, back when I thought I wanted to be a CompSci minor and before I'd even heard about NMI.  This course helped to lay the foundation of my technical/coding knowledge and has made tackling new concepts in NMI courses more comfortable.  Completing this course helped lead me to NMIX and EMST as I knew that I wanted to stay in the technical world, but that CompSci wasn't the right path for me.  The NMI offered instruction on a really cool blend of computational and media skills which bridged the gap between my old major, CompSci, and my new major, EMST.</p>
