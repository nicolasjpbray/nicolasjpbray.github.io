            <p class="text">NMIX 4010 was my first coding class after completing CSCI 1301 and introduced me to a several different web languages and Wordpress.  Some of my most memorable college moments are celebrating my Javascript functions working properly in NMIX 4010 projects!  This class solidified both my desire to finish the NMI Certificate work in web programming after college.  I currently work as a UX designer at Equifax and no class at UGA has helped me more in my day-to-day tasks -- I use a platform very similar to Wordpress to manage hundreds of web pages and custom code made by me.  NMIX 4010 has helped me most in introducing me to Wordpress and teaching me to write Javascript functions, both of which I use ervery week at work.</p>

            <p class="text">My favaroite project from this course was one that challenged us to create a hand-crafted website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that featured an interest of ours.  Having just beaten Doom Eternal, I made a website that revolved around this game using custom fonts and Javacript functions.  Click the above image to view this project.</p>
