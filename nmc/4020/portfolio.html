            <p class="text">I'm currently in this course!  I've been really enjoying expanding my web design skills, specifically some advanced Javacript and CSS (flexboxes have been a dream).  I definitely look forward to completing the homework for this course each week and get to apply what I learn in the professional world as a UX designer at Equifax.  Everything we've learned in this course has helped me improve at my job and take on more interesting/complex personal projects.</p>

            <p class="text">It's really difficult to select a single favorite project so far in this course, but the music player was certainly fun.  I've mae a few music players before but never one that works quite as well as this one.  I think the real deciding factor in the quality of this one was what I've learned in this course about handling data.  Click the above image to rock out to some cool tunes!</p>
